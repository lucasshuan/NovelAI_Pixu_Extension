## What is this?

Pixu is a small browser extension for NovelAI that makes moving images into your stories easier.

Images are stored locally in your browser, so nothing is uploaded anywhere else.

## How it works

You can grab an image from NovelAI image generator and drop it straight into your story, and Pixu handles the insert/attach step for you.
