## What is this?

Pixu is a lightweight browser extension for NovelAI that allows you to display images in your stories to enhance immersion. It works alongside <a href="https://github.com/lucasshuan/NovelAI_Pixu_Naiscript">Pixu NovelAI user script</a>.

Images are stored locally in your browser, so nothing is uploaded anywhere else.

## How it works

You can grab an image from NovelAI image generator and drop it straight into your story, and Pixu handles the insert/attach step for you.

## Install

- Load it as an unpacked extension in your browser
- <a href="https://github.com/lucasshuan/NovelAI_Pixu_Naiscript/releases">Download</a> and import the script into your User Scripts
- Open the <a href="https://novelai.net/stories">NovelAI story page</a>
- Add **Image Slots** in specific sections and click or drag to import an image

## Planned Features

- **Image Generator Integration**: Enable in-story image creation via the NovelAI Image Generator, so you never leave the story view.
- **Scene Auto-Generation**: Add a one-click option to generate images from selected scenes or passages.
- **Character Galleries**: Build local character galleries that keep images and metadata organized.

## Known Issues
