## What is this?

Pixu is a small browser extension for NovelAI that makes moving images into your stories easier. It works alongside <a href="https://github.com/lucasshuan/NovelAI_Pixu_Naiscript">Pixu NovelAI user script</a>.

Images are stored locally in your browser, so nothing is uploaded anywhere else.

## How it works

You can grab an image from NovelAI image generator and drop it straight into your story, and Pixu handles the insert/attach step for you.
